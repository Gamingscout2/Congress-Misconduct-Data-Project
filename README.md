# Congress-Misconduct-Data-Project
A short and simple Python and MySQL project I did using the https://www.govtrack.us/misconduct data to make a SQL database to allow for easier lookup of entries!
I created this as I am studying Computing at Rochester Institute of Technology and with today being the day of the 2024 election (11/05/2024) I got the random idea
to see about crimes and misconduct in the government.  That is when I stumbled upon the .yaml file hosted by govtrack.us on their Github repo at
https://github.com/amyewest/govtrack.us-web and made a Python program that parses anything compatable with the database for congressional misconduct into
a .sql script that creates the usCongress database with the misconduct table.  I might update this when more data is available, however there is enough here that
if anyone wanted to do it themeselves they will be able to!
